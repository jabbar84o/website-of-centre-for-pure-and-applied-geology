            <h2>About CPAG</h2>
            <p>The Department of Geology was established in 1956 at Elsa Kazi Campus, Hyderabad and was shifted to Allama I.I. Kazi Campus, in June 1961, where it was temporarily lodged in the Chemistry Block. In 1971, it was shifted to its present premises which has since then been expanded and a new block along with an Auditorium added to it in 1992. The availability of the additional space has comparatively eased accommodation problem and complete new laboratories have been set in the newly constructed block. It has been upgraded as Centre for Pure and Applied Geology in March 2006 with the approval of the Academic Council as a part of the University’s Mega Project. The department produced a monograph on “Geology of Sindh” in addition to bibliographies pertaining to the various regions of Pakistan. It has completed a number of research projects, e.g. “China Clay (Nagar Parkar)” financed by PSF “Clay Deposits of Sindh” sponsored by PCSIR, “Glass Sand resources of Sindh” and “Resistivity Survey for Ground water in Kohistan Area, district Dadu, sponsored by UNICEF. Recently hydrogeological studies on two research projects funded by the HEC & P.S.F. have been completed. One research project, Paleoenvironmental study of lower Goru Formation in the subsurface of Lower Indus Basin, Pakistan, sponsored and funded by P.S.F has been undertaken. Beside Centre has recently contracted projects on a Feasibility study of Granite deposit of District Tharparkar Sindh and Dimension Stone in Dadu, Jamshoro and Thatta, final reports have been submitted. The Centre is actively participating in collaborative research projects with petroleum exploration companies such as PPL and Weatherford. The Centre for Pure & Applied Geology has started program of internship training of final year students with various Oil Companies operating in the country. It has brightened job prospects for capable students. The Centre offers 04 year BS Geology Program. The Centre has also re-introduced M.Phil / Ph.D. program as of 2003 session. Presently more than thirty students are working for their M.Phil / Ph.D. studies. Earlier three candidates earned their Ph.D. degrees and two M.Phil. A coal Research Lab has been established with the Collaboration of weather ford Oil Tools. M.E Ltd. And a Geophysics chair with the collaboration of PPL is supposed to be established in this year.</p>
            <p>Our programs are designed to equip students with theoretical knowledge and practical skills, preparing them for successful careers in academia, industry, and government sectors. We emphasize hands-on experience, field trips, and modern laboratory techniques to ensure a comprehensive understanding of geological principles.</p>
